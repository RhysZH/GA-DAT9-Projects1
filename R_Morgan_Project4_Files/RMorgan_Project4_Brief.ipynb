    "### Rhys Morgan – DAT9 Project 4 Proposal\n",

    "__Background:__\n",
    "In the age of digital marketing, direct marketing campaigns are perceived as effective in converting leads to sales. By directly presenting a value proposition and creating the opportunity for sales representatives to directly handle objections, companies still use these tactics alongside other channels to generate revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Portuguese bank has collected data on its direct marketing campaigns (phone campaign) focused on subscribing customers to term deposits (Fixed-term investments at an agreed-upon interest rate). \n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem Statement:__ \n",
    "Determine the factors that lead customers to subscribe to a term deposit, in order to optimise the lead nurturing process, reducing the cost and time spent in the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Project Goal:__\n",
    "Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Null Hypothesis:__ \n",
    "A customer subscribing to the product is unaffected by independent variables, which present as random chance. Therefore the probability of a customer subscribing is 50%\n",
    "H0 : P = 0.5, +/- 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "__Alternate Hypothesis:__ \n",
    "A customer’s chance of subscribing is affected by an independent variable, resulting in a higher or lower-than-equal probability of a customer subscribing\n",
    "H1:  P =\\= 0.5 +/- 0.05\n",
    "\n",
    "__Limitations:__ \n",
    "Other factors aside from the data may have contributed to the decision to subscribe (amount of disposable income etc). Also, the exact approach used in the phone call and sales skills of the caller, such as the features of the campaign/product are unknown.\n",

    "1.\t__Age__ (numeric)\n",
    "2.\t__Job__ : type of job (categorical: 'admin.', 'blue-collar', 'entrepreneur', 'housemaid', 'management', 'retired', 'self-employed', 'services', 'student', 'technician', 'unemployed', 'unknown')\n",
    "3.\t__Marital__ : marital status (categorical: 'divorced', 'married', 'single', 'unknown' ; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)\n",
    "4.\t__Education__ (categorical: 'basic.4y', 'basic.6y', 'basic.9y', 'high.school', 'illiterate', 'professional.course', 'university.degree', 'unknown')\n",

    "10.\t__Day_of_week__: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')\n",
    "11.\t__vDuration__: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\n",
